"""
In a file called twttr.py, reimplement Setting up my twttr from Problem Set 2, restructuring your code per the below, wherein shorten expects a str as input and returns that same str but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
def main():
    ...


def shorten(word):
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Then, in a file called test_twttr.py, implement one or more functions that collectively test your implementation of shorten thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

pytest test_twttr.py
